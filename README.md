# JS1 Course Assignment

**Desktop:** ![Homepage Desktop](assets/images/gamehub-desktop.jpg)

On this project we had to decide to use a exsisting (Rainydays) project, or a fresh project. I decided to start a fresh one. I chose the online game store "Gamehub" focused on browsing, filtering, and buying games with an intuitive checkout experience.

## 📝 Description

For this project we used new JavaScript skills to create an interactive online store that displays products from an API endpoint. We could choose from **Rainy Days API**, **GameHub API**, or **Square Eyes API**. The products are displayed in HTML and users can create a basket of items.

- **Home** – Popular and new releases games, and get an introduction to the store.
- **Games** – View all available games and filter by genre.
- **Product** – See detailed information about a selected game, including image, price, and description.
- **Checkout** – Review your cart, enter your details, and complete your purchase.
